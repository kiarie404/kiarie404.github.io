The pressure to not grow organically.   
To catch up with acquaintance classmates.   
The self disappointment that comes from knowing you'll never belong anywhere.  
That your sturbonness will never allow you to settle for safety.  
That your will get nervous breakdowns if you take the safe path. What do you mean It would be safer to be a web dev? Or a mobile dev? What do you mean I have to work to live? What do you mean I have to be professional?  

Life's a huge endless ocean, you either swim or drown. And in the end everyone eventually drowns.   
A constant curse.  
Life is pointless.  

You resort to learning about CS, nature, physics. You hope that you will eventually find purpose.  

You cannot lie to yourself. You realize you will have to walk alone while you become an engineer. You are not the type of engineer who becomes successful early. You are a low-level developer. You have no hope of making money. Doing jobs for the sake of survival makes you suicidal. You cannot convience yourself otherwise.  

Deep down you know that you have to become a hardcore engineer, a low-level engineer. Not because you want to show off, But because you need those skills for your future ambitions. Ambitions that got you in computer science in the first place. You need to be well prepared for moment when you finally meet fellow equal engineers. Engineers who also took their solo low-level development path. Fellow nerds. Engineers who do things because they are interesting, not because they need money. They live for the sake of getting more knowledge. To challenge nature, to challenge Mortality.
